### Coding Standards ###

All code is indented with four spaces, not tabs and [Symfony Coding Standards](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html).  Remember
that the main advantage of standards is that every piece of code looks and feels familiar, it's not about this or that
being more readable.

#### Naming conventions:

* Class member variables are camel case - e.g firstName
* Database column names use underscores - e.g first_name
  * Date time columns end with _at - e.g created_at
  * Boolean columns start with is_ - e.g is_awesome
* Template names use camelCase - e.g firstName.html.twig

### Code Layout ###

A bundle is simply a structured set of files within a directory that implement
a single feature. So, a bundle should be created for each feature.
