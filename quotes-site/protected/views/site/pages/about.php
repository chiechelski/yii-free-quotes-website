			We are a young team of entrepreneurs who believe in assisting people in finding local service providers,
            who provide a high quality job and charge an affordable price. We believe that people should not
            need to spend their precious time searching for reliable service providers in New Zealand and
            that such task should be outsourced to someone who could do a better job that you would otherwise do.

            the little steps that we support and that you can also support:

traffic on our streets and lesser pollution.
			</li>
			<li>
				You can hire service providers who use environmentally friendly cleaning products, free of
harsh chemicals, or using technologies that are more sustainable to the planet, than normal
cleaning products.
			</li>
			<li>
				You can hire service providers who have paperless policies
			</li>
			<li>
				You can support companies that return some of their profits back to the local community
			</li>
            <li>
